# LineFollower-Robot
![Zumo](./Images/Zumo.jpg)  
A robot, which follows a black line using line sensors.  
Special features include:
- A user interface on the OLED screen with 3 different running settings
- Gap Handling
- Time measurement and distance measurement for each run
- Clean error handling

Each week we held 2 meetings to discuss our problems or review the results. After every lecture each team member had a task for that week(depends) and had to create his or her own branch to implement/ solve the task. 
The GITLAB repository was modified so it was not possible to merge branches into the MAIN without the approval of at least one other team member. So before any merge the code and changes were thoroughly reviewed. 
In order for everyone to have a good overview what others are currently working on, we used a ![Kanban Board](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban-Board) using ![Gitlab issue boards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html).


## Goal of the Project
- The ability to realize a greater object-oriented softwareproject
- aswell as the know-how to use the distributed version control system GIT in a smaller team
- Clean documentation using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
- Using UML with [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/de/)
- Well structured software development process - in this case the (V Model)
